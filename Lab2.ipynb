As you can see from this graph, there are a set of values on the top that represent positive sum values and values on the bottom that represent negative sum values. These values represent the average of win points per academic year. For example, in the data you can interpret that years between 2002 and 2010 there is a negative deviation for win points compared to 1987 to 1992. Also, in 1984 you can see it is the most negative value and the color is birght red to represent that. The different shades of color throughout the graph represents how much more negative or positive the values are compared to each other."
